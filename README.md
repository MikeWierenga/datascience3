This is my portfolio for the datascience 3 course.

# Assignments explained
Below all the assignments will have a brief explanation. <br>
The assignments are split between unsupervised and supervised.
## Unsupervised
### Week 1
Week 1 is theory about what methods are used for preprocessing modeling and evaluation.

### Week 2 Clustering
Week 2 I chose to perform text clustering on a python machine learning book. 
The reason for this is to try and understand what is the book about before actually reading it. 
The chapters are separated to get an idea of what each chapter is about.

### week 3
In week 3 I tried to configure the best anomly detection method using gridsearchcv.

## Supervised
The supervised machine learning assignments are mostly about the models that can be used and the evaluation of the models. The dataset is always the same. 
### Week 4
In week 4 we made a supervised machine learning model only using numpy.

### Week 5
In this assignment i learned about the SVC model and how to evaluate a model.

### Week 6
Week 6 we learned about decision trees and naive bayes.

### Week 7
The final assignment is about bagging and boosting algorithms.
